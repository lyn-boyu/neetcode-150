/**
 * Count Number of Islands - Medium
 * 
 * https://neetcode.io/problems/count-number-of-islands
 * 
 * Given a 2D grid `grid` where '1' represents land and '0' represents water, count and return the number of islands.
 * An island is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically and is surrounded by water.
 * You may assume water is surrounding the grid (i.e., all the edges are water).
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: grid = [
 *     ["0","1","1","1","0"],
 *     ["0","1","0","1","0"],
 *     ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 *     ["0","0","0","0","0"]
 *   ]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: There is only one island formed by connecting the land pieces in the first three rows.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: grid = [
 *     ["1","1","0","0","1"],
 *     ["1","1","0","0","1"],
 *     ["0","0","1","0","0"],
 *     ["0","0","0","1","1"]
 *   ]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: There are four separate islands: two on the top right, one in the middle, and one on the bottom right.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 100
 * - grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
