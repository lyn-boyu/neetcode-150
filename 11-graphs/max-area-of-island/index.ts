/**
 * Max Area of Island - Medium
 * 
 * https://neetcode.io/problems/max-area-of-island
 * 
 * You are given a matrix `grid` where grid[i] is either a 0 (representing water) or 1 (representing land).
 * An island is defined as a group of 1's connected horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
 * The area of an island is defined as the number of cells within the island.
 * 
 * Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If no island exists, return 0.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: grid = [
 *   [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
 *   [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
 *   [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
 *   [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
 * ]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The largest island has 6 cells of connected '1's.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 50
