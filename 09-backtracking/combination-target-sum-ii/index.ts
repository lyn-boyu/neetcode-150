/**
 * Combination Target Sum II - Medium
 * 
 * https://neetcode.io/problems/combination-target-sum-ii
 * 
 * You are given an array of integers `candidates`, which may contain duplicates, and a target integer `target`. 
 * Your task is to return a list of all unique combinations of `candidates` where the chosen numbers sum to `target`.
 * 
 * Each element from `candidates` may be chosen at most once within a combination. The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
 * 
 * You may return the combinations in any order and the order of the numbers in each combination can be in any order.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: candidates = [9,2,2,4,6,1,5], target = 8
 * Output: [
 *   [1,2,5],
 *   [2,2,4],
 *   [2,6]
 * ]
 * Explanation:
 * - Possible combinations are: 1+2+5, 2+2+4, and 2+6.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: candidates = [1,2,3,4,5], target = 7
 * Output: [
 *   [1,2,4],
 *   [2,5],
 *   [3,4]
 * ]
 * Explanation:
 * - Possible combinations are: 1+2+4, 2+5, and 3+4.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= candidates.length <= 100
 * - 1 <= candidates[i] <= 50
 * - 1 <= target <= 30

            path.push(candidates[i]);

            // Step 3.2: Explore - recursively call backtrack with updated target sum and next index
            backtrack(i + 1, path, targetSum - candidates[i]);

            // Step 3.3: Undo the choice (backtrack) - remove the last added element from the path
            path.pop();
        }
