/**
 * Non-overlapping Intervals - Medium
 * 
 * https://neetcode.io/problems/non-overlapping-intervals
 * 
 * Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
 * 
 * Note: Intervals are non-overlapping even if they have a common point. For example, [1, 3] and [2, 4] are overlapping, but [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,4],[1,4]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: After [1,4] is removed, the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,4]]
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= intervals.length <= 1000
 * - intervals[i].length == 2
 * - -50000 <= start_i < end_i <= 50000
