/**
 * Max Water Container - Medium
 * 
 * https://neetcode.io/problems/max-water-container
 * 
 * You are given an integer array `heights` where `heights[i]` represents the height of the ith bar.
 * 
 * You may choose any two bars to form a container. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: height = [1,7,2,5,4,7,3,6]
 * Output: 36
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: height = [2,2,2]
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - 2 <= height.length <= 1000
 * - 0 <= height[i] <= 1000
 * 
 * Solution:
 * - Use the two-pointer technique.
 * - Start with two pointers at the beginning and end of the array.
 * - Calculate the area for each pair of pointers and update the maximum.
 * - Move the pointer pointing to the shorter bar to potentially find a taller bar.
