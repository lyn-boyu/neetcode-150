/**
 * Longest Repeating Substring With Replacement - Medium
 * 
 * https://neetcode.io/problems/longest-repeating-substring-with-replacement
 * 
 * You are given a string `s` consisting of only uppercase English characters and an integer `k`.
 * You can choose up to `k` characters of the string and replace them with any other uppercase English character.
 * After performing at most `k` replacements, return the length of the longest substring which contains only one distinct character.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "XYYX", k = 2
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Either replace the 'X's with 'Y's, or replace the 'Y's with 'X's.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "AAABABB", k = 1
 * Output: 5
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= s.length <= 1000
 * - 0 <= k <= s.length
