/**
 * Coin Change II - Medium
 * 
 * https://neetcode.io/problems/coin-change-ii
 * 
 * You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations 
 * (e.g. 1 dollar, 5 dollars, etc) and an integer `amount` representing a target amount of money.
 * 
 * Return the number of distinct combinations that total up to `amount`. If it's impossible 
 * to make up the amount, return 0.
 * 
 * You may assume that you have an unlimited number of each coin and that each value in `coins` is unique.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: amount = 4, coins = [1,2,3]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation:
 * 1+1+1+1 = 4
 * 1+1+2 = 4
 * 2+2 = 4
 * 1+3 = 4
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: amount = 7, coins = [2,4]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: No valid combination can sum up to 7.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= coins.length <= 100
 * - 1 <= coins[i] <= 1000
 * - 0 <= amount <= 1000
